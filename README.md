# Quarkus RESTful Bagel App

This is a project to put together all the knowledge I read from Understanding Quarkus. It was original going to be a small and simple RESTful API which only returned static data and used in memory lists as pseudo databases. It slowly evolved into learning a few other frameworks. It evolved into a bigger RESTful API with an H2 in memory database with typesafe queries.
